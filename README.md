# Ctrl-F++
Ctrl-F++ is an educational Chrome extension aimed to aid students of HTML. 

Our mission is to move users beyond a place of head knowledge into a familiarity with web development. Ctrl-F++, borrowing from its namesake,  searches your current web page's source code for any specified HTML tags and highlights the relevant portions of the web page. 

Find your tags in the wild. Explore. Discover. Engage.
